 */

/**
 * 📋 TESTING SCENARIOS:
 * 
 * To test file functionality:
 * 
 * 1. Create lab order with file result:
 *    INSERT INTO lab_orders (patient_id, test_type, result, status) 
 *    VALUES (1, 'Blood Test', 'uploads/lab_results/blood_test_123.pdf', 'completed');
 * 
 * 2. Test file viewing:
 *    - Click "View" button should open file in new tab
 * 
 * 3. Test file downloading:
 *    - Click "Download" button should download file with proper name
 * 
 * 4. Test file printing:
 *    - Click "Print" button should open print dialog
 * 
 * 5. Test text results:
 *    - Insert lab order with text result
 *    - Should show modal with formatted text and print option
