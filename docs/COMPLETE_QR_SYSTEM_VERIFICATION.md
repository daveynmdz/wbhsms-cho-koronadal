## üîê Security Features Implemented

### QR Code Security
```json
{
  "type": "appointment",
  "appointment_id": 42,
  "patient_id": 7,
  "scheduled_date": "2025-10-13",
  "scheduled_time": "10:00:00",
  "facility_id": 1,
  "generated_at": "2025-10-13 10:30:00",
  "verification_code": "A1B2C3D4"
}
```

### Validation Process
1. **QR Parsing:** Extract appointment_id from JSON
2. **Verification Code:** Validate using `QRCodeGenerator::validateQRData()`
3. **Patient Ownership:** Verify appointment belongs to patient
4. **Status Check:** Ensure appointment is not cancelled
5. **Access Control:** Session-based security

## üì± User Experience Flow

### For Patients:
1. **Book Appointment** ‚Üí QR generated automatically

3. **Security Validation** ‚Üí System verifies QR authenticity
4. **Queue Processing** ‚Üí Automatic status updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- **Storage:** QR codes stored as BLOB in `appointments.qr_code_path`
- **Size:** ~2-5KB per QR code (Google Charts API PNG)
- **Indexing:** Indexed for fast retrieval
- **Backup:** Included in database backups

### API Endpoints
- **Generation:** Internal (part of appointment booking)
- **Retrieval:** `get_qr_code.php` (patient-facing)
- **Scanning:** `checkin.php?action=scan_qr` (staff-facing)
- **Validation:** `QRCodeGenerator::validateQRData()`

### Error Handling
- **QR Generation Failure:** Appointment still created, queue assigned
- **Email Failure:** QR still accessible in patient portal
- **Scanning Errors:** Fallback to manual appointment ID entry
- **Invalid QR:** Clear error messages for staff

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Files Available
1. **`test_complete_qr_system.php`** - Comprehensive system test
2. **`test_complete_appointment_flow.php`** - End-to-end booking test
3. **`test_mysqli_beginTransaction_fix.php`** - Connection validation

### Manual Testing Checklist
