# Quick Production Database Fix

## 🚨 Issue: Missing 'notes' column in referrals table

**Error:** `Unknown column 'notes' in 'field list'`

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Add Missing Column (Recommended)
```sql
-- Connect to your production database and run:
ALTER TABLE referrals ADD COLUMN notes TEXT DEFAULT NULL;
```

### Option 2: Use Fixed Code (Already Applied)
The system now automatically detects if the `notes` column exists and works with or without it.

## 🎯 Test the Fix:
1. Try booking an appointment again
2. The system will now work regardless of whether the `notes` column exists

## 📝 What Was Fixed:
- **Automatic detection** of database schema differences
- **Graceful fallback** when columns are missing
- **No breaking changes** for existing installations

## 🚀 Production Ready:
Your appointment booking should now work perfectly with QR code generation!
