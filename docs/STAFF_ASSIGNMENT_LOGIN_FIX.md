# Staff Assignment Login Fix & Admin Access Control Security

## Problem 1: Staff Assignment Blocking
The system was blocking employee login if they didn't have a staff assignment for the current day. This would cause major operational issues where legitimate employees couldn't access the system.

## Problem 2: Admin Dashboard Security Flaw
The admin dashboard was missing proper role-based access control, allowing ANY logged-in employee (regardless of role) to access admin functions.

## Root Cause 1: Staff Assignment
Multiple role dashboards had blocking logic that would:
1. Check for staff assignment using `getStaffAssignment($employee_id)`
2. If no assignment found, redirect to login with error message
3. Prevent dashboard access entirely

## Root Cause 2: Admin Security
The admin dashboard only checked if user was logged in, but not if they had admin role:
```php
// VULNERABLE CODE
if (!isset($_SESSION['employee_id']) || !isset($_SESSION['role'])) {
    header('Location: ../auth/employee_login.php');
    exit();
}
// Missing role check here!
```

## Fixed Dashboards
The following dashboards were updated to use non-blocking staff assignment checks:

1. **Doctor Dashboard** (`pages/management/doctor/dashboard.php`)
2. **Nurse Dashboard** (`pages/management/nurse/dashboard.php`)
3. **DHO Dashboard** (`pages/management/dho/dashboard.php`)
4. **BHW Dashboard** (`pages/management/bhw/dashboard.php`)
5. **Laboratory Tech Dashboard** (`pages/management/laboratory_tech/dashboard.php`)
6. **Pharmacist Dashboard** (`pages/management/pharmacist/dashboard.php`)
7. **Cashier Dashboard** (`pages/management/cashier/dashboard.php`)
8. **Records Officer Dashboard** (`pages/management/records_officer/dashboard.php`)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Non-Blocking Assignment Check (Fixed Staff Assignment Issue)
Changed from blocking exit() to warning message:
```php
// OLD - Blocking logic
$assignment = getStaffAssignment($employee_id);
if (!$assignment) {
    header('Location: ../auth/employee_login.php?not_assigned=1');
    exit();
}

// NEW - Non-blocking logic
$assignment = null;
$assignment_warning = '';
try {
    $assignment = getStaffAssignment($employee_id);
    if (!$assignment) {
        $assignment_warning = 'You are not assigned to any station today. Some queue management features may be limited. Please contact the administrator if you need station access.';
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $assignment_warning = 'Unable to verify station assignment. Some features may be limited.';
}
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard Security Fix (Fixed Role Access Control)
Added proper role validation to admin dashboard:
```php
// NEW - Secure admin access control
// Check 1: Is the user logged in at all?
if (!isset($_SESSION['employee_id']) || empty($_SESSION['employee_id'])) {
    error_log('Admin Dashboard: No session found, redirecting to login');
    header('Location: ../auth/employee_login.php');
    exit();
}

// Check 2: Does the user have the correct role?
if (!isset($_SESSION['role']) || strtolower($_SESSION['role']) !== 'admin') {
    error_log('Access denied: User ' . $_SESSION['employee_id'] . ' with role ' . 
              ($_SESSION['role'] ?? 'none') . ' attempted to access admin dashboard');
    $_SESSION['flash'] = array('type' => 'error', 'msg' => 'Access denied. You do not have permission to view that page.');
    header('Location: ../auth/employee_login.php?access_denied=1');
    exit();
}
```

### 3. User-Friendly Warning Display (Staff Assignment)
Added conditional warning section to all dashboards:
```php
<!-- Assignment Warning (if applicable) -->
<?php if (!empty($assignment_warning)): ?>
<section class="info-card" style="border-left-color: #ffc107; background: #fff3cd;">
    <h2 style="color: #856404;"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Station Assignment Notice</h2>
    <p style="color: #856404;"><?php echo htmlspecialchars($assignment_warning); ?></p>
</section>
<?php endif; ?>
```

## Benefits
1. **No Login Blocking**: Employees can access their dashboards regardless of staff assignment status
2. **Informative Warnings**: Users are informed about assignment limitations
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Features may be limited but core access is preserved
4. **Better UX**: Clear messaging instead of confusing login redirects
5. **Operational Continuity**: System remains usable even with incomplete staff scheduling
6. **ðŸ”’ SECURITY**: Admin dashboard now properly blocks unauthorized access attempts
7. **ðŸ”’ ACCESS CONTROL**: Role-based authentication prevents privilege escalation

## Security Impact
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Admin dashboard was accessible by any logged-in user regardless of role
- **RISK ELIMINATED**: Doctors, nurses, and other roles can no longer access admin functions
- **AUDIT TRAIL**: Access attempts are now logged for security monitoring

## Fixed Components

### Staff Assignment (8 Dashboards)
1. **Doctor Dashboard** (`pages/management/doctor/dashboard.php`)
2. **Nurse Dashboard** (`pages/management/nurse/dashboard.php`)
3. **DHO Dashboard** (`pages/management/dho/dashboard.php`)
4. **BHW Dashboard** (`pages/management/bhw/dashboard.php`)
5. **Laboratory Tech Dashboard** (`pages/management/laboratory_tech/dashboard.php`)
6. **Pharmacist Dashboard** (`pages/management/pharmacist/dashboard.php`)
7. **Cashier Dashboard** (`pages/management/cashier/dashboard.php`)
8. **Records Officer Dashboard** (`pages/management/records_officer/dashboard.php`)

### Access Control Security (1 Critical Fix)
1. **Admin Dashboard** (`pages/management/admin/dashboard.php`) - Added role validation

## Not Affected
- **Patient Portal**: Uses separate session system

## Testing Recommendation
Test login for each role both with and without staff assignments to ensure:
1. Dashboard loads successfully in both cases
2. Warning appears only when no assignment exists
3. No redirect loops or error messages
4. Core functionality remains accessible

### Security Testing
Test role-based access control:
1. **Admin Access**: Only admin role should access admin dashboard
2. **Access Denial**: Non-admin roles should be redirected with error message
3. **Audit Logging**: Access attempts should be logged in error logs

The fix ensures operational continuity while maintaining awareness of assignment status and securing administrative functions.
