# MySQLi beginTransaction() Production Fix

## Issue Summary
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Environment:** Production  
**Error:** `Fatal error: Call to undefined method mysqli::beginTransaction()`  
**Location:** `/var/www/html/utils/queue_management_service.php:30`  

## Root Cause
The `QueueManagementService` class was designed to work with PDO connections but was being instantiated with MySQLi connections in several files. MySQLi uses `begin_transaction()` instead of `beginTransaction()`, but the service class uses PDO-specific methods throughout.

## Files Modified

### Primary Fix
- `pages/patient/appointment/submit_appointment.php` - Line 333: Changed `$conn` to `$pdo`

### Additional Fixes (Consistency)
- `api/queue_management.php` - Line 39: Changed `$conn` to `$pdo`
- `pages/patient/appointment/cancel_appointment.php` - Line 119: Changed `$conn` to `$pdo`
- `utils/staff_assignment.php` - Lines 75, 107, 137, 155: Changed `$conn` to `$pdo`
- `tests/test_queue_integration.php` - Lines 71, 254: Changed `$conn` to `$pdo`
- `tests/test_appointment_queueing_integration.php` - Line 98: Changed `$conn` to `$pdo`

## Technical Details

### Before (Incorrect)
```php
$queue_service = new QueueManagementService($conn); // MySQLi connection
$queue_service->createQueueEntry(...); // Calls PDO methods internally
```

### After (Correct)
```php
$queue_service = new QueueManagementService($pdo); // PDO connection
$queue_service->createQueueEntry(...); // Uses PDO methods correctly
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Test File Created:** `tests/test_mysqli_beginTransaction_fix.php`
2. **Access URL:** `http://your-domain/tests/test_mysqli_beginTransaction_fix.php`
3. **Expected Result:** All tests should pass with green checkmarks

## Database Connection Architecture

The system maintains dual database connections:
- **`$pdo`** - PDO connection for new services (queue management, etc.)
- **`$conn`** - MySQLi connection for legacy code compatibility

Both connections are available via `config/db.php` inclusion.

## Impact Assessment

### Affected Functionality
- ✅ Patient appointment booking
- ✅ Queue entry creation
- ✅ Queue management operations
- ✅ Staff assignment functions
- ✅ Appointment cancellation

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing MySQLi code continues to work
- PDO code now uses correct connection type
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Production Deployment

### Pre-deployment
1. Backup current production files
2. Test on staging environment first

### Deployment Steps
1. Upload modified files to production server
2. Run verification test: `/tests/test_mysqli_beginTransaction_fix.php`
3. Test appointment booking functionality
4. Monitor error logs for any issues

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur, restore backed-up files:
- `pages/patient/appointment/submit_appointment.php`
- `api/queue_management.php`
- `pages/patient/appointment/cancel_appointment.php`
- `utils/staff_assignment.php`

## Future Prevention

### Code Review Guidelines
1. Always verify connection type when instantiating services
2. Use `$pdo` for new PDO-based services
3. Use `$conn` only for legacy MySQLi code
4. Document connection requirements in service classes

### Service Class Pattern
```php
class NewService {
    private $pdo; // Clearly indicate PDO requirement
    
    public function __construct($pdo_connection) {
        if (!($pdo_connection instanceof PDO)) {
            throw new InvalidArgumentException('PDO connection required');
        }
        $this->pdo = $pdo_connection;
    }
}
```

## Testing Verification

After deployment, verify these key flows work:
1. Patient appointment booking
2. Queue number assignment
3. Queue status updates
4. Staff assignment operations

**Status:** ✅ Ready for production deployment
